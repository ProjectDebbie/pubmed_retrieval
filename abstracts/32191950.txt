Long-term Functional Outcomes of Nonoperatively Treated Highly Displaced Scapular Body and Neck Fractures.
Historically, extra-articular scapular body fractures were treated nonsurgically, but displaced fractures of the glenoid neck can lead to dysfunction. Controversy exists regarding which extra-articular scapular fractures should be treated surgically; however, nonsurgical management of severely displaced scapular body fractures can result in satisfactory outcomes. Inclusion criteria for this study were medial or lateral displacement greater than 2 cm, angular deformity between fracture fragments greater than 45°, or glenopolar angle less than 22°. Functional outcomes included Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Short Form-36 (SF-36) score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder score. Radiographs and computed tomography scans were available for all patients. Range of motion (ROM), strength, other injuries, and complications also were recorded. Twelve patients (10 males, 2 females) with a mean age of 45.6 years (range, 29-57 years) underwent follow-up for a mean of 54.1 months (range, 28.2-74.4 months). At latest follow-up, mean DASH score was 8.9 (range, 0-35), mean SF-36 score was 72.2 (range, 57.3-96.1), and mean ASES score was 85.9 (range, 46.7-100). Mean ROM and strength expressed as a percentage of the contralateral side ranged from 88% to 99% and 70% to 93%, respectively. At longest follow-up, 10 patients reported excellent satisfaction with their treatment. There were no radiographic non-unions. One patient with concomitant clavicle and acromion fractures treated surgically had a postoperative infection requiring operative irrigation and debridement. None of the patients required or sought additional treatment. Nonoperative treatment of highly displaced scapular body fractures resulted in good patient satisfaction, satisfactory long-term functional outcomes, and only minor loss of motion and strength.
