Timing of Surgery in Tubular Microdiscectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation and Its Effect on Functional Impairment Outcomes.
While it has been established that surgery for lumbar disc herniation, excluding emergent indications, should only be performed after weeks of conservative treatment, it has also been established that late surgery is associated with poorer outscomes in terms of leg pain. However, nothing is known concerning the timinig and functional outcome. We quantify the association of time to surgery (TTS) with functional impairment outcome and identify a maximum TTS cutoff. A consecutive series of patients who underwent tubular microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation was included. A reduction of â‰¥ 30% in the Oswestry Disability Index from baseline to 12 months was defined as the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). TTS was defined as time of symptom onset to surgery in weeks. The maximum TTS cutoffs were derived both quantitatively by an area under the curve (AUC) analysis, as well as qualitatively based on cutoff-specific MCID rates. Inclusion was met by 372 patients, among which 327 (87.9%) achieved MCID. MCID achievement was associated with lower TTS (hazard ratio, 0.725; 95% confidence interval, 0.557-0.944; p = 0.014). The optimum maximum TTS based on AUC was 21.5 weeks. The qualitative analysis showed a continuous drop of MCID rates with increasing TTS, with values > 80% until week 14. Our findings suggest that longer TTS is associated with a poorer patient-reported outcome in terms of functional impairment, and that-depending on the calculation method and according to the literature-a maximum TTS of between 14 to 22 weeks should likely be aimed for.
