Polymorphisms in Glycolysis-Related Genes Are Associated with Clinical Outcomes of Paclitaxel-Cisplatin Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
This study was conducted to investigate whether polymorphisms in glycolysis-related genes are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing chemotherapy. A total of 377 patients with NSCLC were enrolled. Sixty-five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 26 genes involved in the glycolytic pathway were evaluated. The associations of the variants with the chemotherapy response and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Among the 65 variants investigated, PFKL rs2073436C>G and GPI rs7248411C>G significantly correlated with clinical outcomes after chemotherapy in multivariate analyses. PFKL rs2073436C>G was significantly associated with both a worse response to chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.45-0.90, p = 0.01) and a worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.14-1.61, p = 0.001). GPI rs7248411C>G was significantly associated with both a better chemotherapy response (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07-2.23, p = 0.02) and a better OS (aHR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.98, p = 0.03). When stratified by tumor histology, PFKL rs2073436C>G was significantly associated with OS only in squamous cell carcinoma, whereas GPI rs7248411C>G exhibited a significant association with the chemotherapy response and OS only in adenocarcinoma. This result suggests that the PFKL rs2073436C>G and GPI rs7248411C>G are useful for predicting the clinical outcome of first-line paclitaxel-cisplatin chemotherapy in NSCLC.
