Creation of the Minority Genetic Professionals Network to increase diversity in the genetics work force.
As diverse racial and ethnic minority populations continue to grow in the United States, the racial and ethnic diversity of the genetics workforce has remained virtually unchanged over the past 50Â years. This is especially true in the genetic counseling profession where 90% of genetic counselors in the most recent Professional Status Survey reported as White. In order to improve access to genetic services and education for minority families, it is important to increase the availability of minority genetic healthcare providers. The Health Resources and Services Administration funded Western States Regional Genetics Network has created a Minority Genetic Professionals Network (MGPN) to recruit and mentor high school and undergraduate students to enter genetic professions such as genetic counseling. The MGPN has also expanded to provide support, education, and mentor matching for current practicing genetic counselors and genetic counseling students. This Network is an initial step towards developing a more diverse genetics workforce to meet the needs of diverse families in the United States.
