Correction of the Saddle Nose Deformity.
Saddle nose deformities are among the most challenging problems in rhinoplasty. These patients have often had previous surgery and may have complicated medical histories. Reconstructing the septum is a necessary prerequisite to correcting the contour of the nose. With proper planning and thoughtful execution, patients suffering from disfiguring saddle noses can be safely operated on-even those with vasculitic diseases.
