Importance of Vascularity and Selecting the Recipient Vessels of Lower Extremity Reconstruction.
 Successful lower extremity reconstruction using free flaps begins by identifying a good recipient vessel and understanding the surrounding environment of the defect.  One should consider multiple factors when selecting the recipient vessel such as the status of the axial arteries, trying to preserve flow as much as possible, extent and severity of the defect, and ultimately what type of anastomosis will be ideal.  Multiple factors of importance are reviewed and show the relevance in decision making and provide an algorithm.  In addition to the multiple factors to be considered, the ultimate decision should be made on the table during surgery when the actual artery or vein is exposed and shows signs of good pulsation and flow.
