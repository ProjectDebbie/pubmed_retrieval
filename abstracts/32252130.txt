Comparing the neurologic outcomes of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest according to prehospital advanced airway management method and transport time interval.
The incidences of prehospital advanced airway management by emergency medical technicians in South Korea are increasing; however, whether this procedure improves the survival outcomes of patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the association between prehospital advanced airway management and neurologic outcomes according to a transport time interval (TTI) using the Korean Cardiac Arrest Research Consortium database. We retrospectively analyzed the favorable database entries that were prospectively collected between October 2015 and December 2016. Patients aged 18 years or older who experienced cardiac arrest that was presumed to be of a medical etiology and that occurred prior to the arrival of emergency medical service personnel were included. The exposure variable was the type of prehospital airway management provided by emergency medical technicians. The primary endpoint was a favorable neurologic outcome. Of 1,871 patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 785 (42.0%), 121 (6.5%), and 965 (51.6%) were managed with bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation (ETI), and supraglottic airway (SGA) devices, respectively. SGAs and ETI provided no advantage in terms of favorable neurologic outcome in patients with TTIs â‰¥12 minutes (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.87 for SGAs; OR, 1.31; CI, 0.30-5.81 for ETI) or in patients with TTI <12 minutes (OR, 0.57; CI, 0.31-1.07 for SGAs; OR, 0.63; CI, 0.12-3.26 for ETI). Neither the prehospital use of SGA nor administration of ETI was associated with superior neurologic outcomes compared with bag-valve-mask ventilation.
