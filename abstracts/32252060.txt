Higher Odds of Type 2 Diabetes for Some Blood Groups.
Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic diseases in humans that cause disruption in glucose and fat metabolism. The determination of the ABO blood group system is hereditary and both diabetes and blood groups have a genetic basis. The aim of this study was to investigate the odds of type 2 diabetes for some blood groups. This case-control study was conducted in hospitals of Kermanshah in 2018. The case group consisted of patients with diabetes admitted to hospital and the control group of nondiabetic patients hospitalized in the surgical ward. Information such as age, sex, BMI, family history of diabetes and blood group is collected and analyzed by the univariate and multivariate logistic regression method. A total of 750 patients were enrolled in this study. The number of participants in both groups was 375. The average ages of the participants were 50.51 and 51.62 years, respectively. 67.5% of the patients in the case group were female in comparison with 73.6% of those in the control group. The value of Rh+ in the case and control groups was 94.4 and 93.6%, respectively (p = 0.645). The chance of having diabetes for patients with blood group A was 76% higher than for those with blood group O (p = 0.006). According to the results of this study, the odds of type 2 diabetes for people in blood group A was higher than for those in other blood groups. It is recommended that blood group A be considered as a risk factor in the screening of type 2 diabetes.
