Increased Release of Proinflammatory Proteins in Primary Human Adipocytes and Activation of the Inflammatory NFĸB, p38, and ERK Pathways upon Omentin Treatment.
To investigate the impact of omentin on the release of inflammation-related biomarkers and inflammatory pathways in primary human adipocytes. Adipocytes were treated with or without omentin (500 and 2,000 ng/mL), and the supernatants were analyzed for inflammation-related biomarkers using proximity extension assay technology. Potential upstream regulators of the omentin-stimulated proteins were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Protein levels of components of inflammatory pathways were measured using Western blotting. 2,000 ng/mL omentin induced the release of 30 biomarkers 97.1 ± 31.1-fold in the supernatants (all p < 0.05). Most biomarkers were proin-flammatory chemokines and cytokines. We identified the transcription factor nuclear factor "kappa-light-chain-enhancer" of activated B cells (NFĸB) and the kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 as potential upstream regulators in silico. On the cellular level, treatment with 2,000 ng/mL omentin for 24 h enhanced the phosphorylation levels of NFĸB 2.1 ± 0.3-fold (p < 0.05), of p38 2.6 ± 0.4-fold (p < 0.05), and of ERK1/2 1.8 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.05). These data argue that omentin exerts proinflammatory effects through the activation of the inflammatory NFĸB, p38, and ERK1/2 pathways in cultured primary adipocytes.
