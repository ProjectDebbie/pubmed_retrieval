Risk Factors for Hardware-Related Complications After Olecranon Fracture Fixation.
The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for symptomatic hardware and removal of hardware (ROH) after olecranon open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and to assess differences between olecranon locking plate and screws (P&S) or tension band (TB) wire cohorts. The medical records of 331 patients with olecranon fractures treated at two academic level I trauma centers with ORIF from 2012 to 2016 were reviewed. A total of 189 patients were included in the study. Complications, ROH, and subsequent surgery were assessed and compared between cohorts. There were 124 cases in the P&S cohort and 65 in the TB cohort. The overall reoperation rate was 31.2% (59 of 189). The overall incidence of ROH for all cases was 29.1% (55 of 189). Patients who required ROH or developed symptomatic hardware were significantly younger than those who did not (P&S, P<.003; TB, P<.004). Age and body mass index (BMI) were associated with ROH plus symptomatic hardware after P&S. Age (but not BMI) was associated with ROH/symptomatic hardware after TB. Measured hardware prominence was not associated with ROH or ROH plus symptomatic hardware for either the P&S or the TB cohort. Risk factors including patient age and BMI were found to be significantly associated with hardware-related complications. [Orthopedics. 2020;43(x):xx-xx.].
