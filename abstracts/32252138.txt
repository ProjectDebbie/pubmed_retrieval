Laparoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer in Korea: Nationwide Data from 2013 to 2018.
We report nationwide data on the current status of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Korea. Nationwide data of patients who underwent surgery for CRC from 2013 to 2018 were obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service database. Data and trends of laparoscopy use for colorectal resection over six years were examined. In Korea, a total of 117,320 patients underwent surgical resection for CRC from 2013 to 2018. The proportion of laparoscopic resection increased from 64.9% in 2013 to 78.5% in 2018. The rate of laparoscopic resection for colon cancer increased from 64.7% in 2013 to 77.4% in 2018. For rectal cancer, the rate of laparoscopic resection increased from 65.4% to 81.6%. Males accounted for 59.8% of all patients, but females surpassed males at over 80 years of age. The age of peak incidence was in the 60's for males and in the 70's for females. A steady increase in the number of patients undergoing surgery for CRC was observed over 80 years of age. The laparoscopic penetration rate for CRC in Korea continued to increase annually and reached 78.5% in 2018.
