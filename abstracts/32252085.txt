Should You Treat This Acutely Ill Medical Inpatient With Venous Thromboembolism Chemoprophylaxis?: Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common and potentially fatal condition. Medical inpatients are at high risk for VTE because of immobility as well as acute and chronic illness. Several randomized trials demonstrated that chemoprophylaxis, or low-dose anticoagulation, prevents VTE in selected medical inpatients. The 2018 American Society of Hematology clinical practice guideline on prophylaxis for hospitalized and nonhospitalized medical patients conditionally recommends chemoprophylaxis for non-critically ill medical inpatients, leaving much to the discretion of the treating physician. Here, 2 experts, a hematologist and a hospitalist, reflect on the care of a woman hospitalized with a rheumatologic disorder. They consider the risks and benefits of chemoprophylaxis, discuss VTE risk stratification, and recommend which patients should receive chemoprophylaxis and with which agents.
