Use of the National Early Warning Score for predicting in-hospital mortality in older adults admitted to the emergency department.
The National Early Warning Score (NEWS), based on the patients' vital signs, detects clinical deterioration in critically ill patients and is used to reduce the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, although mortality prediction based on vital signs may be difficult in older patients, the effectiveness of the NEWS has not yet been evaluated in this population. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that an elevated NEWS at admission increases the mortality risk in older patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). We conducted a single-center retrospective study, including patients admitted to the ED between November 2016 and February 2017. We included patients aged >65 years who were admitted to the ED for any medical problem. The NEWS was calculated at the time of ED admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. In total, 3,169 patients were included in this study. Median age was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 70 to 80 years), and 1,557 (49.1%) patients were male. The in-hospital mortality rate was 5.1% (161 patients). Median NEWS was higher in non-survivors than in survivors (5 [IQR, 3-8] vs. 1 [IQR, 0-3], P<0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the NEWS was associated with in-hospital mortality, after adjusting for other confounders. The area under the curve of the NEWS for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.820 (95% confidence interval, 0.806 to 0.833). Our results show that the NEWS at admission is associated with in-hospital mortality among patients aged >65 years.
