Copeptin with high-sensitivity troponin at presentation is not inferior to serial troponin measurements for ruling out acute myocardial infarction.
We aimed to compare the multi-marker strategy (copeptin and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTnI]) with serial hs-cTnI measurements to rule out acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with chest pain. This prospective observational study was performed in a single emergency department. To test the non-inferiority margin of 4% in terms of negative predictive value (NPV) between the multi-marker strategy (0 hour) and serial hs-cTnI measurements (0 and 2 hours), 262 participants were required. Samples for copeptin and hs-cTnI assays were collected at presentation (0 hour) and after 2 hours. The measured biomarkers were considered abnormal when hs-cTnI was >26.2 ng/L and when copeptin was >10 pmol/L. AMI was diagnosed in 28 patients (10.7%). The NPV of the multi-marker strategy was 100% (160/160; 95% confidence interval [CI], 97.7% to 100%), which was not inferior to that of serial hs-cTnI measurements (201/201; 100%; 95% CI, 98.2% to 100%). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the multi-marker strategy were 100% (95% CI, 87.7% to 100%), 68.1% (95% CI, 61.7% to 74.0%), and 27.2% (95% CI, 18.9% to 36.8%), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of serial hs-cTnI measurements were 100% (95% CI, 87.7% to 100%), 85.5% (95% CI, 80.4% to 89.8%), and 45.2% (95% CI, 32.5% to 58.3%), respectively. The multi-marker strategy (copeptin and hs-cTnI measurement) was not inferior to serial hs-cTnI measurements in terms of NPV for AMI diagnosis, with a sensitivity and NPV of 100%. Copeptin may help in the early rule-out of AMI in patients with chest pain.
