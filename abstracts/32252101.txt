Addition of Caffeine to a Carbohydrate Feeding Strategy Prior to Intermittent Exercise.
The ergogenic effect of caffeine is well established, although no investigations providing a high carbohydrate feeding strategy (pre-exercise meal=2 g/kg BM) co-ingested with caffeine exist for soccer. This investigation examines the effect of caffeine in addition to a pre-exercise carbohydrate meal and drink mid-way through a soccer simulation. Eight recreational soccer players completed an 85-minute soccer simulation followed by an exercise capacity test (Yo-yo Intermittent Endurance test level 2) on two occasions. Prior to exercise participants consumed a high carbohydrate meal, with placebo or 5 mg/kg BM<sub>-1</sub> caffeine. No significant performance effect was identified (p=0.099) despite a 12.8% (109 m) improvement in exercise capacity following caffeine. Rates of carbohydrate and fat oxidation did not differ between conditions and nor were differences apparent for plasma glucose, fatty acids, glycerol, β-hydroxybutyrate (p>0.05). However, an increase in lactate was observed for caffeine (p=0.039). A significant condition effect on rating of perceived exertion was identified (p<0.001), with the overall mean for the protocol lowered to 11.7±0.9 au for caffeine compared to 12.8±1.3 au. Caffeine supplementation with a carbohydrate feeding strategy failed to affect metabolic and metabolite responses, although reductions in perception of exercise were observed. While a 12.8% increase in exercise capacity was noted the findings were not significant, possibly due to the small sample size.
