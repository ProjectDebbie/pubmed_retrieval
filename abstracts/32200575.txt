Influential factors of well-being among Hungarian female hospice workers examined through structural equation modelling.
According to national hospice data in Hungary, approximately 1,600 healthcare employees and volunteers work in hospice care (country population of 9.9 million). The aim of the study was to identify and examine influential relationships among several variables that may affect well-being among female hospice workers. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted utilising survey responses of 179 female hospice workers, including 79 nurses. Path analysis revealed that work over-commitment (being employed in more than one job) contributed to decreased psychological well-being through increased perceived stress, sleep difficulties and vital exhaustion. A greater sense of coherence was associated with lower levels of subjective stress, depressive symptoms and vital exhaustion and negatively correlated with over-commitment. Overall, even though the physical and mental burden of the workers is increasing because of increased use of hospice, according to these results, most still engaged in hospice work. Deeper analysis of the sense of coherence may point to development of effective interventions that can help maintain well-being of hospice workers and reduce attrition.
