Direct and Intervertebral DiscMediated Sensitization of Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons by Hypoxia and Low pH.
Ischemia-related risk factors are consistently correlated with discogenic pain, but it remains unclear how the ischemia-associated hypoxia and acidosis influence the peripheral sensory nervous system, namely the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), either directly or indirectly via intervertebral disc (IVD) mediation. Bovine tail IVD organ cultures were preconditioned in different hypoxic and/or acidic conditions for 3 days to collect the conditioned medium (CM). The DRG-derived ND7/23 cells were either treated by the IVD CM or directly stimulated by hypoxic and/or acidic conditions. Neuronal sensitization was evaluated using calcium imaging (Fluo-4) after 3 days. We found that direct exposure of DRG cell line to hypoxia and acidosis increased both spontaneous and bradykinin-stimulated calcium response compared to normoxia-neutral pH cultures. Hypoxia and low pH in combination showed stronger effect than either parameter on its own. Indirect exposure of DRG to hypoxia-acidosis-stressed IVD CM also increased spontaneous and bradykinin-stimulated response, but to a lower extent than direct exposure. The impact of direct hypoxia and acidosis on DRG was validated in a primary sheep DRG cell culture, showing the same trend. Our data suggest that targeting hypoxia and acidosis stresses both in IVD and DRG could be a relevant objective in discogenic pain treatment.
