Age, Gender, and Body Mass Index as Determinants of Surgical Outcome in Primary Aldosteronism.
Although unilateral primary aldosteronism (PA) should be curable by adrenalectomy (ADX), postsurgical outcome is affected by several clinical factors. Herein we reviewe the importance of age, gender, and BMI as determinants of surgical success based on the recent findings including a nation-wide, multicenter study in Japan (JPAS/JRAS). It is important to determine whether ADX for elderly patients with unilateral PA is as beneficial as younger patients. JPAS/JRAS showed that ADX could benefit elderly patients (>65 years) with definitive unilateral PA in curing of disease and improvement of hypertension, although potential adverse outcomes including hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency need to be considered in some elderly patients at high risk. As shown in previous studies, JPAS/JRAS also demonstrated that female gender was an independent predictor for clinical cure after ADX in patients with unilateral PA. The gender-specific predominance of somatic mutations of aldosterone-producing adenoma and sex hormones with vasculo-protective effects might account for the difference of surgical outcome between genders. Additionally, lower body mass index (BMI) has been shown to be one of the predictive factors for better clinical outcome after ADX. The relation between BMI and surgical outcome is, however, independent from aldosterone, since BMI does not correlate with PAC in PA. Early diagnosis of PA and lifestyle modification including weight control are essential to improve the surgical outcome of the unilateral PA. Thus, clinical practice guideline should include sophisticated strategy of ADX considering not only subtype diagnosis by adrenal venous sampling but also age, gender, and BMI to predict better surgical outcome.
