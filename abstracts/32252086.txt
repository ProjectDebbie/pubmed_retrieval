Hyperthyroidism.
Thyrotoxicosis is a general term for excess circulating and tissue thyroid hormone levels, whereas hyperthyroidism specifically denotes disorders involving a hyperactive thyroid gland (Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma). Diagnosis and determination of the cause rely on clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Other types of thyrotoxicosis are monitored and treated with Î²-blockers to control symptoms given that most of these conditions resolve spontaneously.
