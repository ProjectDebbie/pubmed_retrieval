Role of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation in Treating Children With Overactive Bladder From Pooled Analysis of 8 Randomized Controlled Trials.
Transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation (TENS), as a non-invasive modality, has been clinically used as an alternative treatment for children with overactive bladder (OAB). We conducted a pooled analysis to explore the effect of TENS on OAB. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guideline was followed in this study. The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, as well as the reference lists of the retrieved studies, were used to find trials relevant for assessing the use of TENS to treat OAB. Of the 246 records identified, 8 publications were analyzed in our study. Our analysis found that TENS resulted in a greater decrease of wet days/wk, daily voiding frequency, daily incontinence episodes, and daily number of voids than was observed in the control group. Furthermore, TENS-treated patients showed similar visual analogue scale (VAS) scores to patients in the control group, demonstrating that the application of TENS did not increase patients' discomfort and pain. TENS had a relative advantage in the number of partial responses, but no clear differences were found in frequency of no response or a full response compared to the control group. In urodynamic testing, TENS led to obvious improvements in average voided volume and maximum voided volume in children with OAB. TENS had a remarkable effect on the improvement of urodynamic indexes and objective OAB symptoms without a significant increase in VAS scores for children with OAB.
