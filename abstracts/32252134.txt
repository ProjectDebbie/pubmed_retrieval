Emergency medicine physicians infrequently perform pediatric critical procedures: a national perspective.
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study using a nationally representative database to estimate the frequency of critical procedures (endotracheal tube intubation [ETI], cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], and central line insertion [CLI]) in children and adults. The study was based on the secondary analysis of the 2010-2014 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We included adult and pediatric patients undergoing critical procedures in the emergency department. We extracted demographic and clinical information, including the performance of critical procedures. For frequent procedures (â‰¥1 per year), we estimated the annual number of critical procedures per emergency physician (EP) by dividing the total number of annual critical procedures by the total number of EPs (estimated at 40,000). For infrequent procedures, we calculated the average interval between procedures. We summarized the data with descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There were an estimated 668 million total emergency department visits (24% pediatric). On average, a single EP performed 8.6 (95% CI, 5.5 to 11.7) CLIs, 3.7 (95% CI, 2.4 to 5.0) CPRs, and 6.3 (95% CI, 5.3 to 7.4) ETIs per year in adults. In comparison, a single EP performed one pediatric CLI, CPR, and ETI every 3.2 (95% CI, 1.9 to 9.8), 5.2 (95% CI, 2.8 to 33.5), and 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6 to 8.9) years, respectively. Our nationwide findings confirm those of previous smaller studies that critical procedures are significantly fewer in children than adults. We suggest that. to retain skills in pediatric critical procedures should be developed for general EPs to ensure that they deliver the highest level of care across the entire age spectrum.
