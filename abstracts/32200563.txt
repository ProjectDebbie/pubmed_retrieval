Family presence during paediatric resuscitation and invasive procedures: the parental experience: An integrative review: An integrative review.
The evolvement of family-centred care has been an ongoing process since the Platt Report 1959. Family-centred care has become the modern working model in paediatrics and obstetrics. Parental participation is central to family-centred care. Whether it is applied consistently remains to be concluded. The aim of the study was to describe the family experiences of being present during paediatric resuscitation and invasive procedures. The design used in this study is an integrative review by Whittemore & Knafl. Databases PubMed and CINAHL were searched for primary research concerning the parental experiences of participating in paediatric resuscitation and invasive procedures. Eighteen studies were included in the study. A quality assessment tool was applied. A pro-parental presence was the results of 17 of the 18 included studies. Six common themes were found: 'Being there', 'Calming child', 'Calming parent', 'Having the right', 'Do it again' and 'Seeing is believing'. Including family in resuscitation and invasive procedures requires openness as a working model and demands organisational changes and the updating of guidelines. The inseparability of parent-child is attachment theory practised, an innate quality of being a child as well as a parent. Recommendations are to have a facilitator present during resuscitation and invasive procedures to alleviate stress on everyone's part, enabling family participation.
