Polyunsaturated fatty acids, lung function, and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are thought to modify systemic inflammation. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between PUFA intake, lung function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we used the dataset of 6th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which, a total of 22,948 individuals including 573 participants with a high probability of developing COPD were enrolled. Participants with missing data for the investigated variables were excluded. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between PUFA intake (omega-3 [N3], omega-6 [N6], and total) with lung function, and HRQoL. HRQoL was determined according to the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). Subgroup analysis of older patients was performed. Age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, education, residence, total calorie intake, and predicted FEV1% were adjusted in all analyses. Although lung function was not associated with PUFA intake, EQ-5D index was remarkably associated with N3, N6, and total PUFA intake in a dose-dependent manner. This association was more pronounced in elderly COPD patients. Mean levels of N3, N6, and total PUFA intake were significantly higher in patients having better HRQoL with respect to mobility, self-care, and usual activities. Our results suggest that N3, N6, and total PUFA intake are associated with HRQoL in COPD patients. This association may be attributed to mobility, self-care, and usual activities. Further longitudinal study is required to clarify this relationship.
