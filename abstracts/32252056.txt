A 1-year Prospective Comparative Study of Sutureless Flanged Intraocular Lens Fixation and Conventional Sutured Scleral Fixation in Intraocular Lens Dislocation.
To compare surgical outcomes of sutureless flanged intraocular lens (IOL) fixation and conventional sutured scleral fixation (SF) for secondary IOL implantation in patients with IOL dislocation. This is a prospective comparative cohort study group consisting of 103 all consecutive patients (103 eyes) with IOL dislocation who had vitrectomy with IOL removal and sutured SF (53 eyes) or flanged IOL fixation (50 eyes). Operating time, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive difference, IOL tilt and decentration using swept-source anterior segment OCT, and postoperative complications were measured for 12 months. Operating time was significantly shorter in the flanged IOL fixation than in the sutured SF (19.4±4.6 vs. 48.9±5.2 min, P<0.001). BCVA in both groups was improved at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively (P<0.05). However, both groups did not differ in BCVA during 12 months. Furthermore, there was no difference in the refractive difference, IOL tilt and decentration, and postoperative complications. Sutured SF and flanged IOL fixation had similar visual outcomes and IOL stability in dislocated IOL repositioning. However, the operating time for flanged IOL fixation was less than half that of the sutured SF; thus, this technique could be an efficient alternative option to treat IOL dislocation.
