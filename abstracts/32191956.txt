Revision Rhinoplasty: Conservation versus Deconstruction.
Revision rhinoplasty requires the surgeon to strike a careful balance between conservation and deconstruction. Contemporary rhinoplasty has focused on structural cartilage grafts.

However, the simultaneous use of multiple grafts also leads to an increased deconstruction of natural supports. In this article, we discuss some simple yet effective techniques in revision rhinoplasty in a case-based format.
